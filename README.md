Personal Portfolio Explanation

This project is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple and clean webpage meant to showcase my personal information, skills, and provide access to your resume. Below is a full breakdown of how everything works.


---

ðŸ”¹ HTML (Structure of the Page)

The HTML file is the backbone of the website. It contains all the content and elements that appear on the page, such as text, headings, buttons, and sections.

Key Sections in the HTML:

1. Header â€“ This includes the navigation bar and the logo or site title ("My Portfolio").


2. Hero Section â€“ This is the large banner at the top with a welcome message like "Hi, I'm AMOSU" and a button to download your resume.


3. About Me Section â€“ This part gives a short description of who you are and what you do.


4. Skills Section â€“ This section lists your technical skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a bulleted list.


5. Footer â€“ A small section at the bottom that shows copyright information.

ðŸ”¹ CSS (Styling and Layout)

The CSS file is used to make the website look nice. It changes things like colors, fonts, spacing, background, and how everything is arranged on the screen.

Main Things the CSS Does:

Sets a clean, modern font and background color for the whole site.

Gives the header a dark background with white text.

Centers the hero section and gives the button a stylish look with a dark background and rounded corners.

Adds spacing between the sections to make it easy to read and scroll through.
